## Setting everything up:

Since macOS Catalina now uses ZSH as the default shell, the script might not work. Change to the bash shell by typing `bash` on the terminal before following the steps bellow.

1. Clone the repo on your local environment.
2. Run the install script with:

```bash
sh install.sh
```

The script will setup Node with NVM, install essential software using brew and homebrew/cask, and set Git credentials with a valid SSH key.
